The purpose of this project is to develop an application that acts as a central hub for interacting with devices. This app should be able to connect with local devices on local network. This app is designed to have both a console application or a web-app locally hosted and accesible through a browser. The list of local devices that can be integrated with include laptops, PCs, light bulbs, google home mini, computers and other such internet-connected on the network. All these above devices are accesible dependent on the availability of a supported API or an open library that can perform basic operations. This app is designed to improve convenience of use, and keep privacy settings by enabling only local-network activity and prevent unauthorized access to devices.
